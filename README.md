# A GOOSE Attacker Tool for IEC61850
The digitization of critical infrastructures, such as electric infrastructures, introduces both advantages and vulnerabilities, particularly within Digital Electric Substations (DES) operating under the IEC 61850. Although there exist measures such as the IEC 62351 standard, there remain significant security risks are still present, including a computational cost that often exceeds the processing capabilities of standard devices and a common lack of cybersecurity knowledge among operators. This work focuses on the Generic Object-Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) protocol and its associated vulnerabilities. The paper highlights the need for generating comprehensive datasets that not only include typical substation traffic but also simulate a diverse range of cyberattacks. The primary contribution of this work is the creation of a tool that emulates potential GOOSE attacks within a DES environment, thereby providing valuable resources for testing and developing robust detection and mitigation strategies. The tool marks malicious traffic, stores packet captures, and can be customized for specific attacks and scenarios. By facilitating a more thorough understanding of potential threats, this research underscores the urgency for a collaborative effort among industrial, academic, and governmental entities to enhance cybersecurity in critical infrastructures.
